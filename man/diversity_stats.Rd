\title{Calculate basic genetic diversity statistics from genind or genlight objects}
\usage{
diversity_stats(input.file)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.file}{A genind object, a genlight object, or a list of such objects}
}
\value{
For a single input object, returns a data frame of diversity statistics.
        For a list of input objects, returns a list of data frames, one for each input object.
        In both cases, the function also writes the results to CSV files.
}
\description{
This function calculates basic genetic diversity statistics from a genind or genlight object,
or from a list of such objects.
}
\details{
The function calculates the following statistics for each population:
         N (sample size), Na (allelic richness), %poly (percentage of polymorphic loci),
         Ho (observed heterozygosity), He (expected heterozygosity),
         Fis (inbreeding coefficient), and 95% confidence intervals for Fis (LCI and UCI).

         When processing a list of objects, the function uses the names of the list elements
         (or generates names if they're missing) to name the output files and list elements.
         Any "." in the input object names are replaced with underscores in the output file names.
}
\examples{
## Set directory for results to be written
setwd("path/to/working/directory")

## Load the example data
data(rainbow.genind)

# Calculate diversity stats for a single genind object
res_single <- diversity_stats(rainbow.genind)

# Calculate diversity stats for a list of genind objects
genind_list <- list(pop1 = rainbow.genind, pop2 = rainbow.genind)
res_list <- diversity_stats(genind_list)

}
